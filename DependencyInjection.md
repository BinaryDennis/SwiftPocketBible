# Dependency Injection

There are various techniques for taking a dependency and injecting something else in its place. 

**Swizzling**, dynamically replacing one method with another, is one technique. 
Some even argue that swizzling makes DI unnecessary, but most will argue that its better to have code that makes dependencies explicit, so they are visible, for example in test cases.

There are a few types of dependency injection:
1. Constructor injection
2. Property Injection
3. Method Injection
4. Ambient Context
5. Extract and Override Call


## 1. Construction Injection
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.
Constructor injection should be your **weapon of choice**. When in doubt, start here. The advantage is that it makes dependencies explicit.

```swift
protocol Printer {
    func print(paper: String) -> String
}

struct LaserPrinter : Printer {
    
    func print(paper: String) -> String {
        return "printing..." + paper
    }
}

class Secretary {
    let printer: Printer

    init(printer: Printer) {
        self.printer = printer
    }
    
    func pleasePrint(papers: [String]) {
        for paper in papers {
            self.printer.print(paper: paper)
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Property Injection
In property injection, a dependency is assumed to have been set in a variable, for later use. 

The advantage and disadvantage of property injection is that it separates initialization from injection.

Making a property injection robust is **surprisingly tricky**. For example, do you need to make the getter thread-safe? Should you guard against the property being reset arbitrarily? What is a good candidate as a default value? Make sure the default value doesnâ€™t refer to another library!


```swift
//see Printer and LaserPrinter definitions in example for Constructor injection

class Secretary {
    private var _printer : Printer?
    
    var printer: Printer {
        //In case the printer has not been set by client
        //before its needed, eg in pleasePrint(), fallback
        //on a default printer
        get {
            if _printer == nil {
                _printer = LaserPrinter()
            }
            return _printer!
        }
        set {
            if _printer == nil {
                _printer = newValue
            }
        }
    }

    func pleasePrint(papers: [String]) {
        for paper in papers {
            self.printer.print(paper: paper)
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Method Injection
In Method injection, a dependency is simply passed as an argument to the method. 

Method injection is good when the dependency will vary with each call. This could perhpas be a random number or the current time.

```swift
//see Printer and LaserPrinter definitions in example for Constructor injection

class Secretary {
    
    func pleasePrint(papers: [String], printer: Printer) {
        for paper in papers {
            printer.print(paper: paper)
        }
    }
}

```

## 4. Ambient Context
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```

## 5. Extract and Override Call
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```
