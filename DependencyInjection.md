# Dependency Injection

There are various techniques for taking a dependency and injecting something else in its place. 
Swizzling, dynamically replacing one method with another, is one technique. 
Some even argue that swizzling makes DI unnecessary, but most will argue that its better to have code that makes dependencies explicit, so they are visible, for example in test cases.

There are a few types of dependency injection

1. Constructor injection
2. Property Injection
3. Method Injection
4. Ambient Context
5. Extract and Override Call


## 1. Construction Injection
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```

## 2. Property Injection
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```

## 3. Method Injection
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```

## 4. Ambient Context
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```

## 5. Extract and Override Call
In constructor injection, a dependency is passed into the constructor and captured for later use.

```swift
//FIX example
```
