/*
Swift extensions allow for great flexibility in adding to the functionality of existing Cocoa classes, 
but similar to Objective-C categories, they donâ€™t allow adding a property to an existing class via an extension.
Using objective-c runtime lib, you can utilize 'associatedObject' to get the same behaviour as a property.
